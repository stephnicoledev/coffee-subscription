# Svare Kaffe Coffee Shop

Svare Kaffe Coffee Shop is a fully responsive website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a local, family-owned business and the different types of coffee and drinks they offer to customers.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Utilized CSS Flexbox and three media queries to ensure a responsive design.
- Incorporated some JavaScript for the navigation bar hamburger icon and navigation links.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time building out a fully-responsive navigation bar with a hamburger-style navigation list and I'm thrilled with how it turned out! It's important to me that websites not only are visually appealing on any screen but that the user is able to easily interact with all features of the website and its content.
